Next meeting: Monday 3-4pm UTC

**Attendees**:

- Greg
- Rafael
- Samad
- Anas
- Anita

**Notes**:

- Decide on a team goal – one that covers each other’s goal for the voyage
- Expectations of the team – overcommunicate and be dedicated to the product goal/vision
- What does success look like as a team – going through the process of the voyage even if we don’t finish the project
- How to make decisions – have the project vision statement in mind to decide rightly
- How to deal with conflicts – have a discussion with each other – the scrum master will step in to solve any impediments
- Time commitments – each member is willing to commit to this voyage
- Tech stack – frontend – react; backend – nodejs; Devops - docker

project discussion – The team decided not to do the AI app because it was only frontend but the developers agreed to do both frontend and backend this voyage. Given that, the team agreed to come up with project ideas we could implement. Here are the documents for The decision log and The project ideas. Let us edit it asynchronously directly on the main branch for now

**Action Items**:

- Place ideas in the project ideas document
- Read the handbook and agile – scrum values and pillars - <https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/guides/voyage/topics/voyage_soft_skills.md>

**Resources**:

- Here's the [new schej link](https://schej.it/e/cdFD7) to indicate our general availability throughout the weeks
- Chingu project showcase - <https://dev.to/chingu> -- for inspiration
- The handbook for chingu that we referenced in the meeting has a treasure trove of generally helpful information that we can use individually, and more specifically voyage related guides and resources that will help us navigate the sprints to come.
